<h3 id="PI-1">Origin of the violin.</h3>

<p>The invention of stringed instruments is certainly of great antiquity,
but exact information with regard to the origin of the violin has not
come down to us. Although stringed instruments were in use before
Christian times, we know that these had nothing in common with the
violin, or that at any rate the bow was not then known. It is therefore
presumed that its invention and use in connection with stringed
instruments occurred in the first century of the Christian era.</p>

<p>Many are, notwithstanding, of the opinion that the use of the bow was
known in pre-Christian times,—in India and in Persia. Pictures of
Indian and Persian bowed instruments exist, but the period when they
were employed is not exactly known. <a href="#FIG_1">See Fig. <i>a</i> and <i>b</i></a>
of page 2.</p>

<h3 id="PI-2">The oldest violins</h3>

<p class="no-indent">known are those of the Tyrolese Lute maker Gaspard
Duiffopruggar (Tieffenbrucker), made in the 16ᵗʰ century. A few of
these instruments remain to the present day, and are noticeable on
account of their fine, clear tone, as well as for the neatness and
elegance of their workmanship.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-3">Development of the violin.</h3>

<p>After Duiffopruggar the following makers were those who chiefly
laboured to perfect the violin:—Gaspard da Salo (middle of the
17ᵗʰ century), Giovanni Paolo Maggini (1590-1640), Andreas Amati
(1520-1580), his sons Antonius and Hieronymus Amati, the son of the
latter, Nicolas Amati (1596-1684), the pupils of the same: Jacob
Stainer (1621-1683) and Antonius Stradivarius (1644-1737). Of the
Amati violins, those of Nicolas Amati are the best; the most perfect
specimens of violin making, at present unsurpassed, were made by Stradivarius.
In his instruments everything is perfected, — tone, model, varnish, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>After Stradivarius the finest violins are those of his pupil Joseph
Guarnerius del Gesu (1683-1745), and there are many of them which rank
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
with those of Stradivarius. To the Guarnerius family of violin makers
belong Andreas Guarnerius, pupil of Amati (middle of the 17ᵗʰ century),
his son Joseph Guarnerius (1680-1730), Peter Guarnerius and the son of
the elder (Andreas) Guarnerius (1725-1740). The names Stradivarius and
Joseph Guarnerius mark the highest achievement of violin making, and
to the present day none have succeeded in surpassing them. Of other
Italian violin makers who have furnished us with good instruments
may be mentioned Alessandro Gagliano (1695-1725), Carlo Bergonzi
(1712-1750), Laurentius Guadagnini (close of the 17ᵗʰ and beginning
of the 18ᵗʰ century), Joh. Bapt. Guadagnini (1755-1785), Dominicus
Montagnana (1715-1750), Vincent Ruggeri, Giov. Bapt. Ruggeri, and Peter
Jacob Ruggeri (beginning of the 18ᵗʰ century). In France, good violins
were made by Lupot (18ᵗʰ century), Gand, Bernardel (19ᵗʰ century)
and Vuillaume (1798-1875). In Germany, besides Stainer and his pupil
Albani of Botzen, Klotz, (father and son) 17ᵗʰ and 18ᵗʰ century in
Mittenwalde; Witthalm (18ᵗʰ century, Nuremburg); Bausch (father and
son, Leipsic, 1805-1871 and 1829-1871), Jacob Diehl (Hamburg). In
England, B. Banks, Salisbury (1727-1795); R. Duke, London (1754-1780);
Jacob Fendt and C. Harris (early part of the present century), and
Matthew Hardie (Edinburgh), have left many good violins.</p>

<h3 id="PI-4">Prominent makers of the present day.</h3>

<p>Good violins are made in the present day by Hammig in Leipsic;
Reichers, Berlin; Schunemann, Schwerin; Pfab, Hamburg; Lenk, Frankfort;
Reuner, Berlin; Roth, Markneukirchen, etc.</p>

<p>[In England excellent instruments have been and are being made by
Hill, Hart, Chanot, E. Withers, and Boullangier, London; W. H. Mayson,
Manchester; F. Devoney, Blackpool; J. Monk, Merton, Surrey; and others.
In France, by Miquel, Foucher, Lotte; and in America, Gemunder.
These have all produced serviceable instruments. Ability to judge
properly the merits of a violin,—whether new or old,—comes only with
experience; beginners should therefore before purchasing consult a
player or teacher possessing the necessary knowledge. Violins by the
same maker, to all appearance exactly alike, yet frequently differ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
greatly in tone quality, and an instrument of bad tone is a stumbling
block in the path of progress, disheartening the learner. <i>Tr.</i>]</p>

<h3 id="PI-5">Attempts at improving the violin.</h3>

<p>Many attempts have been made at improving the violin by altering its
form and proportions, and by using other kinds of wood:—metal, glass,
and porcelain violins have also been constructed. Experiments have
been made with the bass bar, bridge, soundpost, etc., in endeavours
to make a further advance in violin making; but all these attempts
have yielded no results of importance. The most remarkable attempted
alteration of latter days proceeds from the piano maker Hagspiel in
Dresden, and consists in bending or arching the upper table of the
violin instead of working it out, the sound-holes appearing as round
openings in the ribs instead of in the upper surface. The tone of these
violins is of surprising power and volume, but they demand a peculiar,
and somewhat firm bowing; a heavier bow is also needed. The maker
proceeds on the assumption that there exists, in modern orchestras a
tonal gap between the string and the brass instrument. The tone of the
stringed instruments is often quite overpowered by the predominating
force of the wind instruments. This is especially noticeable in opera
orchestras, where their space will seldom permit of more than 10 or 12
first violins, and the same number of second violins; for instance in
the instrumentation of Wagner’s Nibelungen Ring. In its production the
wind instruments need so much space in the orchestra, that instead of
a corresponding increase in the number of the strings, they must often
be lessened, naturally occasioning a want of balance. A selection of
the instruments made by Herr Hagspiel,—violins, violas, violoncelli
and double basses, would probably tend to lessen this disproportion,
as one of them yields at least as much tone as two of the ordinary
instruments. By sufficient familiarity with the method of using them,
the tone might be made to blend uniformly with that of the other
instruments in passages of a light and soft character. In any case the
inventor has thrown out a suggestion, and made a beginning towards
preparing the way for a correct balance of tone in the orchestra, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
his idea therefore deserves consideration. The author is not aware
if practical experiment in the orchestra has been made with these
instruments, but it should certainly give some advantageous result.</p>

<p>Another invention has been produced recently by Herr Christopher
Scheinert in Berlin. It consists of a vibrating hammer or tongue for
stringed instruments. This is a little instrument placed under the
bridge of the violin, so that, (it being furnished with a slender
hammer), elastic metal tongues vibrate freely between the upper table
and the strings. The vibrating hammer is set in motion through the
strings by the bow, through which simultaneous movement the power of
the instrument is increased, and the tone colour elicited. Experts have
tested the contrivance, declaring it to be a happy idea.</p>

<p>Professor H. Ritter’s invention of the normal three-footed bridge must
also be mentioned. Assuming that the bridge in use for centuries,
with its prescribed feet, does not fully convey the vibrations of the
strings to the upper table,—the two middle strings sounding feebler
than the outer,—Prof. Ritter has made a middle point of contact
between the bridge and the upper table. This inner support is intended
to make the middle strings sound with the same intensity as the outer ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="333" >
</div>

<p>In his pamphlet on the subject (Wurzburg, G. Herz), Herr Ritter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
demonstrates that his three-footed bridge has not only an aesthetic
significance, but claims consideration scientifically.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3 id="PI-6">Attempts to discover the secrets of measurement<br>
    of the Italian violin makers.</h3>

<p>For a long period violin making was restricted (deviations such as
the experiments explained above, notwithstanding) to imitating the
first Italian masters of the art, and endeavouring to equal them.
But so conscientious and true in all their parts and contents is
the workmanship of the Italian instruments that this has not been
attained. A very general opinion is, that certain secrets in instrument
making were known to the Italian masters but have become lost, and
many have made the attempt to re-discover these secrets. A maker in
Aix la Chapelle, named Niederheitmann, a violin amateur, possessing
a collection rich in valuable old violins, believed the mystery
to be discovered, and that it consisted in impregnating the wood.
The substance used was a species of pine found in the vicinity of
Cremona, or the instrument was mainly built of this wood. This pine
(balsam pine) became quite decayed by the drying up of its resin, and
thereby the key to the enigma why in spite of the closest imitation
the old Italian tone was not arrived at, was found. This pine exists
no longer in Italy, and thus was to be explained the reason why
notwithstanding the closest copying of existing instruments, the old
Italian tone quality was not reproduced. A friend of Niederheitmann’s,
Concertmeister Henry Schradieck (formerly of Leipsic) interested
himself greatly in this discovery, and having obtained through a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
chemist a similar resinous substance, made, with the aid of Herr
Hammig in Leipsic many trials with this impregnation, from which a
remarkable result was to be got, but which was not of long duration.
Herr Schradieck, who went later to America, knowing that the balsam
pine still grew there, did not rest until he found this tree, believing
that instruments made from it would again approach the old Italians.
Several violins were found already made with balsam pine wood, but the
brilliant expectations that were cherished were not fulfilled.</p>

<h3 id="PI-7">Points of note in the old Italian violins.</h3>

<p><i>Maggini violins.</i> These instruments are of large outline. The
upper table is highly arched and the arching rises somewhat suddenly
from the edges. The wood of the upper table is thick and very good. The
back, compared to the upper table is less thick. The wood of the back
is taken slab-wise (the trunk of the tree being cut in layers across
the whole breadth).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The sides are shallow. The varnish is thin, transparent, and of a clear
brown colour. The purfling is frequently doubled; and spread over the
back in arabesques. The tone of the Maggini violins is full and heavy,
resembling the viola quality. The ticket is as follows:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_011a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="109" >
</div>

<p><i>Andreas Amati.</i> These are mostly of small model. The upper
table is of good, fairly thick wood, and very highly arched towards
the middle. The back is cut on the slab. The varnish is brown and
transparent. The tone is delicate and not powerful.</p>

<p><i>Antonius and Hieronymus Amati.</i> The violins issued as the work
of the two brothers in partnership are much esteemed. More instruments
of small than of large size were, however, produced by them. The upper
table is highly curved, and has towards the edges a groove or furrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
The wood of the back and of the ribs cut slab-wise. The varnish
resembles that of Andreas Amati’s violins. The tone is also small. The
label runs:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_012a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="144" >
</div>

<p><i>Nicolas Amati.</i> These instruments are distinguished from those
of the other Amati violins by a grander appearance, better and thicker
varnish, and a more brilliant and penetrating tone. The scroll is
somewhat small in proportion to the body. Label:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_012b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="134" >
</div>

<p><i>Stradivarius.</i> In the career of Stradivarius three periods may
be traced, and the violins proceeding from each, of these distinct
periods themselves vary more or less. The instruments of the first
period differ but little from Amati violins, and are classified as
being of the school of Nicolas Amati. The instruments of the second
period are already quite different from the first. The whole model is
larger, the arching finer, the wood of the upper table and also of the
back is stronger, and the varnish redder in colour. From the third
period proceeded the finest violins that are in existence. The model
is again somewhat larger, the upper table is flatter, the wood of the
back and of the ribs instead of being cut on the layers in slab form
(sur couche), is taken on the quarter (sur maille). The varnish is
still more brilliant, yet soft looking, and so transparent that the
beauty of the wood underneath it is fully brought out. The f holes
are wonderfully cut, and the entire work is finely finished in every
detail. The tone fulfils every possible requirement, it is of great
power and body, sparkling, noble, and yet sympathetic and sweet. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
violins made in the last years of Stradivarius reveal the weakness
pertaining to old age. The tone is still fine, but the workmanship
is altogether inferior. From this time forward, when the arching is
more prominent, and the varnish darker, the beauty of the tone is
diminished. Label:—</p>

<h3 id="PI-8" class="spa1">Imitations of old Italian violins.</h3>

<p>The old Italian violins have been so closely copied by many makers,
with regard to model, wood, varnish and appearance of age, that it
is difficult to discriminate between the genuine and the spurious.
It is still more difficult when the copy possesses a fine quality of
tone. It needs a practised, keen eye to determine the genuineness or
spuriousness of an instrument, and it may well be that many, believing
themselves to have bought a real old Italian instrument, have only
obtained an imitation thereof. The inside ticket has of itself been
closely copied, and may be purchased in sheets.</p>

<h3 id="PI-9">Constituent parts of the violin.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
  <p class="f110 spa2"><b>Exterior.</b></p>
  <img src="images/i_014b.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="586" >
</div>

<p>The most important part is the upper table or belly (a). The other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
parts are the ribs or sides (b), the back (c), the neck (d), the head
comprising the scroll and peg box (e), the pegs (f), the finger board
(g), the bridge (h), the tailpiece (i), the button<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
(k), the nut (l), and the f or sound-holes (m). The interior of the
violin contains the soundpost and the bass bar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <p class="f110 spa1"><b>Interior.</b></p>
  <img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="581" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-10">Function of the Soundpost<br> and the bass bar.</h3>

<p>The soundpost, placed underneath the right foot of the bridge (a little
way behind it) supports the upper table against the pressure of the
strings upon the bridge, and the bass bar serves a similar purpose
under the left foot of the bridge. The sound post, by connecting the
upper table with the back, sets the entire instrument into vibration,
and by its help the sound waves radiate to all parts.</p>

<h3 id="PI-11">Position of the Bridge</h3>

<p>The bridge must stand on the middle of the upper table so that both
feet are in line with the nicks of the f holes. Through the forward
pull of the strings,—increased during playing,—the bridge has a
tendency to bend forward. To avoid this one must frequently watch, and
pull it backward, yet keeping the feet in the same place. The bridge
may be fixed sloping somewhat backward rather than
forward.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-12">Amount of pressure upon<br> the upper table.</h3>

<p>Through the combined influence of the strain and pressure of the
strings upon the upper table, it supports a weight of about 100 lbs.
Against this burden, this, in other respects, fragile instrument,
opposes a wonderful power of resistance, an example of its ingenious
yet simple construction.</p>

<h3 id="PI-13">Size of the violin.</h3>

<p>The violin measures in the length of its body 14 in., in breadth
in the upper part 6⁹/₁₀ in., in the lower 8³/₁₆ in. The top height
of sides 1³/₁₆ in.; bottom height of sides 1¼ in. Three sizes are
distinguished,—“full”, “three-quarter”, and “half” size. These last
serve for children.</p>

<h3 id="PI-14">The wood of the violin.</h3>

<p>The upper table is made of pine. This must be very old, dry, compact,
straight in grain, whereby the choice of suitable wood is rendered
difficult. For the back, ribs, neck and bridge, maple is used. The
sound post and bass bar consist usually of pine. For the fingerboard
and pegs<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
ebony is the most serviceable.</p>

<p>The old Italian violin makers procured their pine wood from Italian
Switzerland, and from the South Tyrol; maple from Croatia, Dalmatia,
and Turkey.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-15">The varnish.</h3>

<p>This is of great importance for the instrument. In the first place it
preserves it from the influence of the weather, and then it also has
its influence upon the tone. A fine varnish must be transparent, so
that the wood underneath may be fully shown up, and it must also be of
a fine, but not glaring or staring, colour. The finest varnish is found
on the violins of Stradivarius. Two kinds of varnish are used,—spirit
varnish,—a gum dissolved in alcohol; and oil varnish,—a gum dissolved
in oil of turpentine.</p>

<h3 id="PI-16">The strings.</h3>

<p>Violin strings are made from the intestines of sheep. The lowest string
has fine wire spun round it, silver wire being the best. Copper wire is
greatly used, it being much cheaper. The best strings are obtained from
Italy, from Rome, Padua, and Naples, although very good strings are
also manufactured in Germany, at Markneukirchen. The value of a string
consists principally in its perfect equality of thickness throughout;
above all, there must not be knots in it. A string spun quite evenly
yields accurate vibrations, and is on this account pure in tone.</p>

<p>In order to test the purity of tone of each string, it may be held as
shown at both ends, pulling it rather tight, and then setting it into
vibration with one of the fingers. If it appears double, thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_018a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="130" >
</div>

<p class="no-indent">it possesses a pure tone; if, however, it appears threefold,—if only
at one part of it,—it will be false.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_018b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="134" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-17">Strings pure in fifths.</h3>

<p>To obtain absolutely pure intonation, the strings must be pure in
fifths, i. e., the notes in those higher positions which are pressed by
one finger across two strings, must sound perfectly true. Many strings
are rather thicker at one end than at the other; if this is not also
the case with the adjacent string, or if the thicker end of it be not
stretched in the same direction as the other string, then the two are
not true in fifths with each other. Both strings must therefore lie
from one end to the other regular in thickness, or else their thin ends
must be laid in one direction.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
In the latter case, however, all the harmonic notes are not true, and
one also notices that the intervals in double-stopping generally, as
well as in fifths, are not regular upon all the strings. A treatment
is in vogue by makers of strings and instruments by means of which the
strings are rendered quite pure in fifths. These prepared strings are,
however, not so durable, nor so good in tone, as the unprepared. But
it is of service to have always a few of these in readiness, as the
violinist has not always time enough to select those strings which are
true. Weichhold, Dresden, supplies strings pure in fifths, which may be
recommended.</p>

<h3 id="PI-18">The string guage.</h3>

<p>In order always to have strings of the same thickness, a string guage
is used, which may be procured at any instrument maker.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="157" >
  <p class="f110 spb2">String guage.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<h3 id="PI-19">Care of the strings.</h3>

<p>That the strings may be kept fresh, it is advisable to wrap them in oil
paper and then preserve them in a close, air-tight tin box. In this way
they may be preserved in fit condition for a year or more.</p>

<h3 id="PI-20">The bow.</h3>

<p>This received its name from its ancient form, which has undergone many
alterations before the present form was arrived at.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_020a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="163" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_021a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="439" >
</div>

<p>The greatest improvement in the bow was attained by the Frenchman,
Tourte, at the end of the 18th century. His bows possess the greatest
elasticity and firmness, and are, in consequence, the most successful.
After Tourte, Vuillaume in Paris, John Dodd in England, and L. Bausch
in Leipsic, have made the best bows. At present the most celebrated
bow makers are Tubbs in London, Knopf in Dresden, and Voirin in Paris.
French bows are most in request, although many of them are made in
Germany, sent <i>en gros</i> to Paris, stamped there as French, and
issued to the world as of Parisian make.</p>

<h3 id="PI-21">Constituent parts of the bow.</h3>

<p>These are (a) the stick, (b) the hair, (c) the nut, (d) the screw, (e)
the head or point, (f) the lapping.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_021b.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="72" >
</div>

<p>The stick is made of Pernambuco or Brazil wood; the hair is white horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
hair, that taken from living horses being the best, though less often
obtained. The screw serves to give the stick its proper curve. The
lapping helps to give the fingers a firmer hold, avoiding contact
with the smooth stick. Silk, silver wire, or leather is used for the
lapping.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3 id="PI-22">Resin.</h3>

<p>To set the strings in vibration, the hair of the bow must be rubbed
with resin. Its German name “Kolophonium” is derived from the Grecian
town Kolophon, from whence it was first procured. The unprepared
hair of a new bow requires a small quantity of powdered resin rubbed
into it. Before the bow is used, the hair should be tried upon some
instrument not in use, or upon a stretched string. During the ordinary
rubbing upon the hair, care must be taken that the resin is not rubbed
hard, but allowed to glide lightly over the hair.</p>

<div class="figleft">
  <img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="158" >
</div>

<p>It is very usual to hold the resin with the left and the bow with the
right hand. In this way the fingers of the left hand become sticky
with resin dust, which is detrimental to the stopping, and also soils
the strings and fingerboard. It is better, therefore, to reverse this
procedure. Good resin is supplied by Gand and Bernadel in Paris, Hammig
in Leipsic, Pfab and Diel in Hamburg, and others. The most suitable
holders are those which open on two sides, and are also provided with a
cover.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h3 id="PI-23">Violin cases.</h3>

<p>A good violin is worthy of a good case, to protect it against dust and
damp. It should be so filled that the violin lies in it securely, and
yet may be easily taken out. A leather covering for the case is also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
convenient, by means of which the effects of any sudden shock are
minimised. The best cases are mostly obtained from Paris, though some
very good ones are made in Markneukirchen.</p>

<h3 id="PI-24">Prices of violins.</h3>

<p>It is not easy to state the exact price of a violin, especially of
an old one, and here particular fancy and habit come also into the
question. The best old Italian violins, such as those by Stradivarius
and Guarnerius, are in our own time excessively dear, often £300 to
£1000, and even more. Stradivarius received for his violins about 4
Louis d’or. Amati violins are considerably less, costing from £150 to
£300. Other old Italian violins, if in fine condition, cost £30 and
upwards. New violins by celebrated makers may cost from £15 to £30, yet
one can often get a very useful instrument for from 50/- upwards.</p>

<h3 id="PI-25">Prices of Violin cases.</h3>

<p>Cases cost from 5/- to £3, the latter price including a leather
covering.</p>

<h3 id="PI-26">Prices of bows.</h3>

<p>The bows of Tourte now cost £25 and upward. New silver mounted bows
of best quality cost about 30/-, mounted in German silver about 18/-.
Inferior qualities may be had from 3/- upward. The worth of a bow to
its possessor consists in its firmness and elasticity, and in its
proving fit to execute every kind of bowing with certainty.</p>

<h3 id="PI-27">Care of the instrument.</h3>

<p>The instrument must always be kept clean and in order; every part
should always be in proper condition. The dust from the resin must,
every time after playing, be wiped from the upper table, fingerboard
and bridge with a soft cloth. The strings, fingerboard and neck are
then rubbed with an old silk handkerchief, taking care not to rub the
strings to and fro, but always in one direction, else small fibres may
be loosened. If the strings are dirty through perspiring fingers, the
upper three strings may be rubbed with a little neats’ foot oil or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
almond oil, or a notched almond may be used. The G string may be
cleaned with spirits or by rubbing with fine (No. 1) glass paper. The
encrustation of resin upon the surface of the strings may be removed
with spirits, observing that nothing drops upon the upper table, to
injure the varnish.</p>

<p>To keep the neck quite smooth it may be occasionally rubbed with
pulverized pumice stone put into a little muslin bag.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The dust that accumulates inside the violin may be removed by warming
some very fine gravel or grains of wheat, and throwing them inside. The
instrument is then shaken about, and on shaking the grains out again
through the f holes, the dust comes away also. To make the pegs work
easily and yet hold fast, they must frequently be rubbed with dry soap
and then with chalk, where they come in contact with the peg box.</p>

<h3 id="PI-28">Cleaning the hair of the bow.</h3>

<p>If dirty, unscrew the nut from the stick, and wash the hair with warm
water and soap. Then rinse in cold water, and hang up the bow to dry.
When again screwed up, powdered resin is rubbed into the hair with a
little brush. Spots of grease are extracted by rubbing with salt in
blotting paper, or by a hot iron with blotting paper wrapped around it.</p>

<h3 id="PI-29">Naming and tuning of the strings.</h3>

<p>The four strings of the violin are tuned in perfect fifths. The first
is the E string (1ᵃ), the second the A (2ᵈᵃ), the third the D (3ᵃ), and
the fourth the G (4ᵃ). The usual practice, when the pitch of the A is
determined, is to tune the D to it, the G to that, and lastly the E to
the A.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h3 id="PII-1" class="spa1">Attitude of the player.</h3>

<p>When playing from notes the player places himself opposite the desk a
little to the left, so that the violin does not hide the notes from
view. The body should be erect, but not stiffly so. The right foot is
put outward, the left straight, so that the toes are in a line. The
weight of the body must rest chiefly on the left foot.</p>

  <p class="center">Chin-rest.</p>
</div>

<p>The violin is held with the left hand and rests on the left collar
bone. The instrument must be horizontal. To give a firm grip, a small
pad is often placed between the violin and the left shoulder. A
chin-rest screwed to the ribs, and covering a part of the upper table,
is also to be recommended. The chin-rest serves also to protect the varnish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>To prove that the violin is held securely and well, the left hand may
be removed.</p>

<h3 id="PII-3">Position of the left hand and the left arm.</h3>

<p>The left hand is placed so that the neck of the violin is held between
the lower joint of the thumb and the third of the index finger. The
neck must not be gripped, but <i>lightly</i> held<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>,
and care taken that between the neck and that part of the hand which
connects the thumb and first finger, there is an open space. The inner
part of the hand is kept away from the fingerboard, so that the fingers
may fall upon the strings from above. The position of the left arm must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
be such as to bring the elbow far enough to the right to place it
underneath the middle of the violin. To attain a correct manner of
holding, place the first finger on</p>

</div>


<p>The fingers being lifted simultaneously, and allowed to remain in
position over the strings, the position of the hand will be correct.

<h3 id="PII-4">Holding the bow.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="198" >
</div>

<p>The thumb is placed with its fleshy part close to the projection from
the curved part of the nut, taking care that the middle knuckle is
not bent inward, but always in an outward direction. The second joint
of the index finger must rest against the stick. The middle finger
is placed opposite the thumb upon the stick, whereupon the other two
fingers follow, close to these. The little finger will then about rest
with the lower part of its point on the stick.</p>

<h3 id="PII-5">Position of the right hand and arm.</h3>

<p>The right hand must project somewhat forward, and above the bow, and
must be suitably arched. The carriage of the arm must be light, and the
elbow not prominently lifted. When playing on the lower strings, the
position of the hand and the lower part of the arm will naturally be
higher.</p>

<h3 id="PII-6">Testing the position.</h3>

<p>Having succeeded in acquiring a firm hold of the instrument and of
the bow, it is best to examine before a looking-glass the attitude of
the whole body, which must be natural and unconstrained. The body and
head should be held erect, the shoulders somewhat back. When beginning
to draw the bow across the strings the manner of holding should be
examined and corrected after every stroke before proceeding further.</p>

<h3 id="PII-7">Bowing.</h3>

<p>The bow is placed on the string at the nut, or lower part of the bow,
the stick being tilted towards the fingerboard. The bow must be drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
steadily to its point, and exactly parallel with the bridge, whereby
the wrist is compelled to move, and at the end of the stroke, on
reaching the point of the bow, sinks so that the little finger only
rests at its extreme tip upon the stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="497" >
</div>

<p>The upper arm is so held that with down strokes the elbow remains below
the shoulder, until a third of the bow is left over. If the production
of a louder tone is desired, the bowing is made closer to the bridge
and in <i>piano</i> passages further away from it. The necessary power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
for producing louder tone is obtained only from the thumb, index
finger, and wrist and the fore-arm is held as independently as possible
of the upper arm.</p>

<h3 id="PII-9">Use of the down and up bows.</h3>

<p class="spb1">As a rule, in every piece beginning with a full bar a
down bow is used for the first note, and in a piece beginning with a
single stroke on the up-beat (unaccented beat) or an up-beat consisting
of several notes bound together, <i>legato</i>, the up bow is used. If
the up-beat contains several notes, it must be so arranged that the
last of these is played with an up bow. For example:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_032a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="177" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_032a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Exceptions to the rule of beginning a full bar with a down bow often
occur; for instance, if the first bar begins <i>piano</i>, gradually to
<i>forte</i>, as in the opening of the Freischütz overture:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_032b.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="117" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_032b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here one begins with the up bow, because afterwards at the nut end more
power can be brought to bear, thus bringing the forte into effect.
A further example of exceptional treatment is the beginning of the
Euryanthe overture:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_032c.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="132" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_032c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Equally there are exceptions to the rule of beginning up-beats with the
up bow:—
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<h3 id="PII-10" class="spa1">The first bowing exercises.</h3>

<p>The violin being properly held, and the entire attitude being correct
in every particular, the fingers of the left hand are placed on the
strings as follows:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_033c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="140" >
</div>

<p>Upon lifting them, let them remain over the strings in the same
position.</p>

<p>The open strings are then bowed, and preferably at first the D string.</p>

<p>After each bow, let a pause be observed, to examine every detail of
the position, and to revise it. The bowing exercises on the open
strings are to be continued until at last notes varying in value from
semibreves to crotchets are played with ease and certainty, and an even
tone of good quality produced. The first bowing exercises are usually
as follows:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_033d.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="129" >
    <img src="images/i_033e.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="100" >

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_034a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="96" >
</div>

<p>Each of these exercises should also be played upon the other strings.
The exercise in minims and crotchets in half strokes and in the middle.</p>

<h3 id="PII-11">Placing the fingers.</h3>

<p>The first exercise consists in setting the first finger on all the
strings in succession, then the second in conjunction with the first, the
third in conjunction with the other two, and finally the fourth is added.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_034b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="219" >
</div>

<p>In the same manner on the other strings. If one desires to remain in
the key of C<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
the first finger when on the E string must be drawn back a semitone
to stop F, and on the G string, the 2ⁿᵈ finger must be put forward a
semitone to play the note B. The remaining notes are stopped alike on
all the strings. It is better at first not to adhere to the scale, but
to stop the notes of the other strings as shown above on the D string;
thus producing the following tones:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_034c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="133" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_035a.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="263" >
</div>

<p>Next must be practised the putting back of the first, and the advancing
of the second fingers on all the strings, then the advancing and
withdrawal of all the fingers. Example:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_035b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="648" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
The fingers must so descend upon the strings that the first joint
stands perpendicularly upon them. The pressure of the fingers upon the
strings must always be in excess of the pressure of the bow. According
to one’s playing, whether forcible or light, so the pressure of the
finger is increased or decreased. In slow movements and long notes only
that finger is pressed down which has to play the note. The others
are lifted, yet so that each one is suspended exactly over its proper
place. In ascending scale passages in quick time, the fingers are
allowed to remain; in descending passages, one finger is lifted at a
time. The observance of this rule greatly facilitates true intonation
in descending scale passages, as, each finger being already in its
place upon the note to be played, these places have not again to be
separately found. There are, however, exceptions which will come under
notice later. After the setting back of the first finger and the
putting forward of the second finger have been successfully practised,
the “free”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
setting of the 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ, and 4ᵗʰ fingers follows.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_036a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="85" >
</div>

<p>All the notes in regular order from the open G on the G string to B on
the E string must now be played.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_036b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="170" >
</div>

<p>To attain certainty of fingering in the lower position, one of these
two methods must next be adopted. Either intervals—thirds, fourths,
fifths, sixths, sevenths, and octaves from each note on each string, in
C major, must now be practised, or all the major and minor scales may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
next be played, with the practice of the intervals in all the keys.
Choice must be made as to which method of study be next pursued,
according to the individuality and intelligence of the learner.</p>

Here great care must be taken to distinguish between the differences
that exist in these intervals, whether the 3ʳᵈ is minor or major; the
fifth perfect or imperfect, etc.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the practice of intervals for the left hand, bowing
exercises for the passing of the bow from one string to another must
be taken, also skipping over a string as in sevenths and octaves. The
scales, and, later, intervals and chords, must likewise be studied with
various bowings and also legato. First, two notes should be taken to
one bow, then gradually more, also with single notes and bound notes
mixed. The practice of intervals may now be extended to the following.</p>

<h3 id="PII-15">The various kinds of bowing.</h3>

<p>These are best classified into “primary” bowings (Grund-Bogenstriche)
of which there are six different examples, and “secondary” bowings
(Neben-Bogenstriche).</p>

<h4>Primary bowings.</h4>

<p>1. The rapid detached stroke with the whole bow (Grand detaché). This
is executed in such a manner that the bow moves quickly from its nut to
its point, and back again in the same line,—parallel to the bridge.
Between each stroke there must be a pause, but during it the bow must
not leave the string. It must be so quickly executed that a crotchet is
made to sound like a semiquaver.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_041a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="85" >
</div>

<p>Rendering:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_041a.mp3">[Listen Line 1]</a></p>
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_041b.mp3">[Listen Line 2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The stick must be firmly held between the thumb and the first and
second fingers. The elbow, at the commencement of the down stroke must
rest close to the body, and, on reaching the point of the bow, not be
raised above the stick. Especial care is needed in order to make the up
strokes equal in power to the down strokes.</p>

<p>2. The “singing” stroke. Also executed with the whole bow. The first
contact must be delicate, and the single tones must follow each other
without interruption. The player, drawing the bow quite parallel with
the bridge, must press more and more as the point is reached. At the
change of stroke, the wrist makes a slight movement, and the elbow
assumes the same positions as in the previous grand detaché bowing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_041c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="104" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
3. The detached hammered (martellato) bowing. This stroke is chiefly
made at the point of the bow, which must not leave the string. With
every note the stick is pressed or pushed by the thumb in the direction
of the index finger, so that each tone is sharply cut out, but with a
musical quality. The up strokes must receive a stronger pressure.</p>

<p>This bowing can also be played at the nut end, and of course entirely
with the wrist, which must be held lightly over the strings. The elbow
must be tolerably close to the body. The martelé bowing is an excellent
preparatory study for staccato, which is really only one out of a
number of martelé notes taken in one bow.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_042b.mp3">[Listen Line 2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>4. Detached stroke with the fore-arm. As indicated by its name, is
executed by the fore-arm and the wrist, and from the middle to the
point of the bow. The upper arm must remain quite still. In this bowing
no pause must be made between the notes, but they must be connected
easily and agreeably together.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_042c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="93" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_042c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>5. The “skipping” stroke. This stroke is made at the middle of the bow,
which must be lightly held between the fingers and controlled by the
wrist. The stick is made to vibrate strongly, whereby the bow is caused
to move up and down. It is difficult to attain an agreement between
the placing of the fingers and the skipping movement of the stick, for
which reason this bowing must first be practised on one note:—

different strings.</p>

<p>6. The rebounding or springing (sautillé) bow. This bowing differs from
the foregoing in that the bow rebounds from the string after each note,
and is then permitted to fall upon it again from above. In order to
avoid too great dryness or hardness in the tone, the bow when falling
on the string must be gently controlled.</p>

<h4>Secondary bowings.</h4>

<p>1. The bound, or legato bowing. In this, as many notes are played at
one stroke as may be found connected by the curved legato sign, or as
necessitated by the phrasing. In passing from one string to another the
wrist will require special watchfulness.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_043e.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>2. The staccato stroke. This is, as already stated, a series of martelé
notes taken in one bow, and must first be slowly practised with the up
bow, to the point, and with a free wrist; the thumb only exerting a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
slight pressure upon the stick. The staccato is also executed with the
down bow, beginning near the nut.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_044a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>3. The springing staccato stroke. This consists of a series of
rebounding notes (“Primary bowing” No. 6) taken in one bow, and can be
rendered both by the up and the down bows.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_044b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="93" >

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_044d.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>4. The Tremolo is a succession of quick notes in very short strokes,
and is executed with a loose wrist, the upper half of the bow lying
upon the strings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_044e.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="118" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_044e.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another species of Tremolo is the following:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_044f.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="73" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_044f.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Here two notes are included in one bow, thus causing it to resemble the
skipping stroke. Only the upper half of the bow is used, and it is held
lightly with the thumb and first two fingers.</p>

<p>5. The Ponticello. This is executed with the bow lying quite close to
the bridge, whereby the tone becomes somewhat nasal. When so produced
by the whole string orchestra it often makes a fine effect.</p>

<p>6. Flautando. Also with the bow resting on the string, but, unlike the
foregoing bowing, it is executed just over the fingerboard. The notes
so played yield a delicate flute-like quality of tone.</p>

<h3 id="PII-16">Arpeggi.</h3>

<p>By arpeggi is meant the intervals of a chord in quick succession.
These may be extended over three or four strings with the most varied
bowings and rhythms. Particular care must be taken to keep the wrist
flexible.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h3 id="PII-17">The Vibrato or close shake</h3>

<p>is a trembling similar to the vibrato of a vocalist. Employed
occasionally and with discretion it is of good effect. On the violin
it is produced by setting the finger in tremulous movement upon the
string, so that the pitch slightly rises and falls. Only the thumb and
the finger in use must participate in the holding of the instrument.
There is no special sign for the close shake in general use, its
employment depending upon the player’s taste. Sometimes it is indicated
by the word vibrato.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h3 id="PII-18">The Trill.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/l_paren.jpg" alt="_" width="40" height="131" >

    <img src="images/r_paren.jpg" alt="_" width="40" height="131" >
</div>

<p>The trill is an even alternation,—usually quick,—of two adjacent
notes and may be executed on all the notes of the violin. The note
played alternately with the principal note may be either a tone or a
half tone distant. The trill is made both with and without a turn at
the end. The turn is played in one bow with the shake, and at the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
speed. Exceptions exist in shakes ending with a full close. In a series
of shakes the turn is reserved for the last:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_047a.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="104" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_047a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Various kinds of turns:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_047b.jpg" alt="_" width="500" height="97" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_047b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter">
    <p>Final shake.</p>
    <img src="images/i_047c.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="82" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_047c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Usually the lower note of the two constituting the trill is taken
first. If it is intended that the upper note should begin the trill, it
will be indicated by a small note before the principal note:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_047d.jpg" alt="_" width="200" height="105" >
</div>

<p>The upper note of the trill is always understood to be in accordance
with the key. If it is meant to be raised or lowered a semitone, a
sharp or flat will be placed over the shake.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <p>Final shake.</p>
    <img src="images/i_047e.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="103" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_047e.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To execute the trill evenly, it must first be practised slowly. The
finger making the trill must be lifted high, falling upon the string
with firmness and elasticity, so that it is again lifted high. The bow
meantime passes lightly over the string. The trill is studied upon
every note in both tones and semitones.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<h3 id="PII-19">The Mordent (Pralltriller).</h3>

<p>The mordent is a single alternation of two notes preceding the
principal note, and is generally indicated by the following sign:—</p>

<h3 id="PII-20">The double trill.</h3>

<p>To this species of shake, difficult of execution, applies all that has
been said about the single trill. The player’s chief care will consist
in making both fingers fall quite simultaneously upon the strings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<h3 id="PII-21">Scale practice.</h3>

<p>Scale practice demands diligent application. By its means we attain
certainty of intonation, power and flexibility of tone, as well as
familiarity with the various kinds of bowing.</p>

<p>The beginner must now practise all the major and minor scales, in the
first position, first in moderate tempo, with whole bows:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_049a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="118" >

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_049b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Then with short detached strokes in the middle of the bow, at the
point, and also at the nut, and with the foregoing “primary” bowings,—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_049c.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="79" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_049c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">all with the utmost possible tone, and afterwards
with varying nuances:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_049d.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="204" >

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_049d.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
The scales are then practised with varying bowings and rhythms, legato
and staccato, for example:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_050a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="568" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_050a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="PII-22">Fingering of the scales.</h3>

<p>To each note in the first position belongs its own finger, whether the
note is raised or lowered a semitone, the same finger being used. As a
rule in ascending passages the open string is used; downwards, the 4ᵗʰ
finger is preferred in its stead. If the notes of the open strings are
raised a semitone, usually the 4ᵗʰ finger plays it on the string below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_050b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="157" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_050b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
If the scale begins with such a note, the first finger will be used
twice in succession; for example:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_051a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="138" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_051a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<h3 id="PII-23">The chromatic scales.</h3>

<p>In the chromatic scales, the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ fingers will each be
used twice in succession, and of course must be pushed forward (or
backward) with firmness to the next note. The 4ᵗʰ has one note only on
each string assigned to it. The fingering will be the same, whether the
scale is expressed by sharps or flats:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_051b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="590" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_051b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another system of fingering, utilizing the open strings, is as
follows:—</p>

<h3 id="PII-24">The Positions.</h3>

<p>The various places for the left hand, up and down the neck, are known
as the positions, and each is determined by the place reached by the
first finger. If the hand is so placed that the first finger is ready
to press down these notes</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_052b.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="103" >

<p class="no-indent">it will be the second position.</p>

<p>The ball of the thumb must not touch the neck. As in the first position

<h3 id="PII-25">Changing the position.</h3>

<p>Sliding from one position to another must be executed with ease and
certainty, and it is especially necessary to grip the violin between
the chin and the collar bone, in order to give the hand free play.
Particular care must be bestowed upon</p>

<h3 id="PII-26">Sliding the fingers whilst<br> changing positions.</h3>

<p>If in passing to a higher or lower position, the last note of the
position just left, and the first of the position aimed at, have to be
played by the same finger, it must slide over the string firmly, <i>and
without leaving it</i>, whether the notes in question are legato or not.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

</div>

<p>If the first note, when ascending to a position, is to be played by a
finger following that used in the lower position, the first must slide
with it, remaining until the position of the hand is again changed, or
until released by an advancing finger. The first note must be played
firmly by the finger assigned to it, without causing the slide to be heard.</p>

<p>In the following examples, the accompanying fingers are indicated by
small notes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_055c.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="99" >

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_055e.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the notes of the different positions are to be taken upon <i>two</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
strings, the finger goes with it to the higher position, but without
necessarily remaining on the string.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_056a.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="90" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_056a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In proceeding downward to another position, the finger on the last note
slides with that which is proceeding in advance so far as to find its
place in the lower position, but with the understanding that in case
the note that follows is not to be played with the same finger, it must
not remain down.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_056b.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="101" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_056b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the first note of higher position is to be played by a finger which
is not the last used in the lower position, it must slide with it until
the proper place in the higher position is reached, but must be lifted
as soon as the finger which has to play the first note is put on the
string.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_056c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="107" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_056c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>If the first note in a lower position is to be played with a finger
that in the upper position is ultimately replaced by the finger
following, the finger in question must slide from the upper position to
its place in the lower. But ere it has reached it, the first note in
this position must be gripped.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_056d.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="107" >

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
If the notes of the different positions are not bound together by means
of <i>legato</i> signs, this sliding of the finger must take place
so quickly that no notes are heard between. If the notes are bound
together to be played in one bow, then the <i>portamento</i> or slide
will be audible. The player must beware lest the <i>portamento</i>
from one tone to another becomes exaggerated, or perhaps the entire
enharmonic scale lying between the notes will be produced. All
“whining” must be avoided, and the note next that to which the finger
is sliding should not be heard.</p>

<p>The violinist must know the major and minor scales in all the
positions, above all acquiring certainty in the various positions. On
this account stress must be laid on the study of the same with the
greatest possible diligence.</p>

<h3 id="PII-28">Double stops.</h3>

<p>The violin is capable of producing a great variety of double notes or
double stops. In conjunction with an open string, all the intervals may
be given.</p>

<p class="center">Unisons:</p>

</div>

<p>In unisons, the note given by the open string is produced
simultaneously on the next lower string. The fingering adjusts itself
according to the position in which one is playing, and it may be
practised in the first four positions.</p>

</div>

<p>At <i>a</i>, the lower note will be played on the lower string, but at
<i>b</i> the upper note is produced on the lower string. The fingering

<p>It is necessary to remark that the foregoing examples do not give the
fingering of the scales in double stops, only the fingerings which may
be used in double stops as met with singly.</p>

<p>To these double stops without open strings, those in conjunction with
an open string (<a href="#PII-28">pp. 53, 54</a>) can still be added by this
means, —that they are played on two lower strings; e. g.</p>

<h3 id="PII-29">Chords of three notes.</h3>

<p>In triple stops the two upper notes have mostly the same duration,
the lower note being previously released by the bow. Three notes may,
however, be made to sound simultaneously, but special skilfulness
is requisite, and the sounds cannot be of long duration. Formerly
Paganini, Ole Bull, and other violin virtuosi, used a very flat bridge
in order to play in three and four parts. Such tricks may be produced
even with the ordinary bridge, by unscrewing the nut of the bow,
passing the stick underneath the fiddle, letting the hair lie upon the
strings, and holding both hair and stick together with the right hand.</p>

<p>As a rule, when several chords in three or four parts succeed each
other, they are played with down bows in order to obtain the necessary
power and equality of tone. Here and also in the four part chords which
follow, the easiest are those which make use of the open strings:</p>

<h3 id="PII-31" class="spa2">Harmonics.</h3>

<p>Natural and artificial Harmonics, or Flageolet tones, may be produced
on the violin. The natural harmonics are obtained by placing the finger
quite lightly, and without pressure, upon the string, and bowing with
great care. From the middle of the string upwards towards the bridge,
and also from the middle towards the nut, lie natural harmonics at the
nodes of the string. The sign indicating that a note is to be played as
a harmonic, is either 0, <i>flageolet</i> or <i>son harmonique</i>.</p>

<p>In the case of harmonics which yield a note differing from that stopped
by the finger, the actual sound produced is indicated by the sign

<h3 id="PII-32">The pizzicato.</h3>

<p>The most usual method of playing pizzicato is by means of the index
finger of the right hand, by which the string is gripped and plucked.
The thumb is placed against the fingerboard. In pieces to be played
pizzicato throughout, the thumb may be employed. In this case the
violin is held down (underneath the right arm), as, for instance, in the
Serenade in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, when the violin replaces the mandoline:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_073b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="137" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_073b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The sign used is <i>pizz.</i>, its cessation, <i>arco</i>. The
pizzicato is also possible with the left hand, and is chiefly thus
employed when notes played by the bow and pizzicato notes follow each
other quickly. Left hand pizzicato is indicated by + over the notes,
and is usually executed by the finger which has pressed down the
preceding note, or else with the fourth finger.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_073c.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="133" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_073c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_074a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Notes may be also played <i>arco</i> and <i>pizzicato</i>
simultaneously, for example,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_074b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="286" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_074b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Chords also sound well pizzicato, as for instance,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_074c.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="131" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_074c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
If it is desired that the tones shall vibrate well, the thumb is
released from the fingerboard, and the fingers of the left hand remain
pressed down on their notes. Pizzicato stops in chords are also mixed
with notes played by the bow, and are then plucked with the second
finger of the right hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="150" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_075.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>arco</i> notes are played at the heel of the bow, and with the
up stroke.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PART III.</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="PIII-1">The rendering.</h3>

<p>The rendering of a piece implies its artistic reproduction, every
necessary artistic resource being therein blended. The violinist is
capable of a perfect rendering only if,—in addition to a firm, easy
technique of the left hand, adroitness in bowing and susceptibility
to the modifications of tone, and a technique equal to all demands
made upon it,—he has under his control a higher spiritual musical
development, fine taste, and a warm individual feeling. Only through
the combination of all these qualities can one reinvest the dead signs
of the composer with spirit and life, and cause his work to pass before
the hearer’s soul as an ideal, living picture.</p>

<h4>Intellectual culture.</h4>

<p>Under this head must be included a knowledge of the theory of music,
which renders possible the clear understanding of the sequence of ideas
which the composer has expressed through time, degrees of movement,
dynamic signs, melodic periods, and the harmonies upon which they
are constructed, the rhythmic combinations; and through all these
peculiarities the character of a piece as well as the individuality
of the composer. And where special directions for the rendering are
not employed, to perceive from the text of the work itself the correct
rendering.</p>

<h3 id="PIII-2">Taste.</h3>

<p>To render a piece of music with taste, signifies the reproduction of
the same so that the hearer perceives through the player a complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
understanding of it, and throughout its performance receives a correct
impression of its character. If an artist has given expression to
all the composer’s written dynamic gradations of tone colour with
understanding and feeling, it will be artistically refined; if infused
with his own individuality, and if no awkwardness appear technically
with respect to the manipulation of his instrument, his performance
will be regarded as tasteful.</p>

<p>It should be especially his concern to avoid the numerous faults common
to many players; for example, “whining,” a mawkish drawling from one
tone to another, exaggeration of the close shake on the part of the
left hand, inartistic accentuation, unmeaning throwing of the bow upon
the strings, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 id="PIII-3">Individuality.</h3>

<p>If the artist has studied and learned how to give expression to the
individual feeling of the composer, his own individuality in the
performance is also of great consequence. It consists in this: that the
same piece in performance shall appear ever fresh and new. Individual
feeling is subject to continuous change, through influences from within
and without, consequently an artist who has acquired a full and active
control over all his powers does not perform a piece the second time
in precisely the same manner as the first time. Where however, this is
the case, it may be regarded as a sign that the performer has not yet
arrived at a complete artistic freedom.</p>

<h3 id="PIII-4">Phrasing.</h3>

<p>Upon this subject no exhaustive treatise will be given, but only some
observations upon intelligent phrasing as applied technically to violin
playing. As in singing, and in wind instruments the breath, so in the
playing of stringed instruments the change of bowing, is the potent
medium through which phrases are divided, distinguished from each
other, and rendered clear. Stringed instruments present considerably
greater difficulty in this respect than singing, on account of the
manifold kinds of stroke in bowing,—often within the compass of a
short phrase the most varied bowings occur; moreover, it cannot be laid
down that with each phrase or period the stroke must be changed. These
phrases may, however, in many cases coincide with the change of bowing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and the player must in general make it his aim to obtain correct
phrasing by a suitable application and adjustment of the changes in the
stroke.</p>

<p>The following examples from Mendelssohn’s violin concerto are often
incorrectly phrased, through changing the bow in the wrong places:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_078a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="265" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_078a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The above passage is thus rendered by many violinists:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_078b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="121" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_078b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and in David’s edition of the concerto
it is even marked thus:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_078c.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="128" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_078c.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and a similar passage in this way:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_078d.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="122" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_078d.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
A prolongation of this theme also shows incorrect changes of bow,
from which wrong phrasing ensues:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_079a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="338" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_079a.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The bowings indicated underneath the notes show the correct phrasing,
and also the effect aimed at in connecting the idea with the previous
example.</p>

<p>In passages where the phrasing is not plainly defined by the changes of
bow, the change occurring in the middle of a phrase, the strokes must be
made to follow each other as smoothly as possible (i. e. without a break):</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_079b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="323" >
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_079b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Passages which, owing to rapid time and bowing, are not easily to be
rendered clear by the player, must at least have the real meaning of
the phrase indicated with correct accentuation. It will then become
apparent in the rendering; for example.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_080b.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="205" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_080b.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p><i>c.</i> Concerto by Lipinski (Bowing marks by David).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_081.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="618" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_081.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here the phrasing would become clearer and more intelligible if the
legato signs were made to include the notes next to them in the
following passages: (1) the E in the second bar; (2) as far as D in the
fourth bar; (3) E in the sixth bar, (which would be better tied to the F♯);
then in the following bar the two d’s could be played in one bow, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is still harder than in compositions by violinists or in pieces
marked by them, to make the right changes of bow in the sense of the
phrasing in the works of composers who are not thoroughly familiar
with the technical handling of the violin, and whose indications of
bowing are somewhat eccentric, or merely mark the difference between
staccato and legato. Even our classical composers have not always been
sufficiently strict in this respect, and the appropriate phrasing has
been supplied by many violinists, as for example in the Quartets of

<p>The fingering is just as essential to correct phrasing as the
bowing. Generally the changes of position are made so as to suit the
requirements of the phrasing, that it may be rendered smoothly. This is
particularly needful in long sequences of notes on one string.</p>

<p>In the first four bars the positions are not so well suited to the
phrasing as compared to bars 5 and 6.</p>

<p>In this passage from Richard Wagner’s “Siegfried”, most players change
the position with the first note of the third bar, whereas it should
occur after this note, on the C♯. In order to render it so, the 4ᵗʰ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
finger may be taken three times in succession, beginning with the
highest C♯. Here also the changes of bowing should coincide with the
phrasing marked.</p>

<p>It is essential to a correct rendering that, even in the first pieces
played by a beginner, a perception of the phrasing as a whole should be
acquired; not, as is usually the case, regarding the bowing marks and
the legato signs as exclusively determinative of it. In this respect,
unfortunately, there is nothing offered for the student’s enlightenment
and the improvement of his taste in the existing violin methods; at
least, no method is known to me containing apposite suggestions and
remarks on this head.</p>

<h3 id="APP-1">Pictorial representation<br> of the bow-strokes.</h3>

<p>The signs in general use indicating the down and up strokes,
are these
<span class="fs_120"><b>┌─┐ ٧</b></span>.</p>

<p>The first sign indicates the lower end of the bow, or nut (Ger. “Frosch”),
the second, the upper part or point (“Spitze”).</p>

<p>Hermann Schroeder, in his edition of Kreutzer’s 42 Studies (dedicated
to Joachim), has introduced a further development of these signs. They
are not placed in their usual position, but sideways.</p>

<p> Example:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="482" >
    <p class="center"><a href="music/i_084.mp3">[Listen]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The same in a simpler and more condensed style.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_085a.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="313" >
</div>

<p>Read from the left, the bowings in the first example are shown together
with their notes, and the signs of up and down strokes are then to
be found in their ordinary positions. The editor of the Studies has,
however, given the preference to the employment of the second manner
of writing these, on account of the simplified and easily produced
representations of the bow, and also because of the compressed form of
the bowing strokes given below it. The pictorial signs for the bowing
are more particularly for use in such studies as exemplify different
methods of playing, or such as have groups of repeated phrasings and
bowings; in the remaining studies they are employed wherever the
ordinary signs and terms do not suffice to show the relative extent of
the distribution of the bow.</p>

<h3 id="APP-2">The mute.</h3>

<div class="figright">
    <img src="images/i_085b.jpg" alt="_" width="200" height="148" >
</div>

<p>The mute is a clamp with three notches, which, to obtain a muffled
tone, is fastened on the bridge between the strings. Its use is
indicated by “con sordino,” its removal by “senza sordino,” or by
“with” and “without mute”. There are also mutes which are fastened to
the violin in order to avoid this noisy fixing and unfixing, being
brought into action by a slight push. These mutes are not made as a
clasp, but consist of a small plate which presses against the bridge,
and not upon it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<h3 id="APP-3">The simultaneous sounding of<br>
subordinate and combination tones.</h3>

<p>Without entering into the province of musical acoustics, the well-known
experiment only can be mentioned here demonstrating that mingled with
the notes one plays, others are audible. It is with this object that
a snuffbox or a key is laid on the upper table of the violin. If one
plays double stops in slow tempo whilst one of these articles is thus
placed, not only two notes, but three, four, or even more, may be
heard. In order to obtain good and correct progressions in harmony, the
double notes played must follow in suitable sequence. Generally, two
intervals of the same kind should not follow each other.</p>

<p>In order to make the sympathetic tones more plainly audible, and at the
same time to obviate the whizzing noise produced during the bowing by
the article placed on the upper table, Hermann Schroeder has invented
an apparatus called “Vibrator for the production of harmonic overtones,
and for the reinforcement of the combination tones of stringed
instruments” (Germ. R. Patent No. 40224).</p>

<p>The inventor says in his specification “Researches into the sympathetic
tones of instruments of the violin species, and a theory deduced
therefrom as to the movement of the bow upon the strings”, (Leipsic, C.
W. Fritzsch) amongst other things the following:—In order to produce
upon stringed instruments—more especially the violin,—the harmonic
overtones of the notes played, as well as the combination tones, a
weight (g) is brought over the upper table of the violin fastened to
it, but allowed free play. This weight, when the instrument is being
played, vibrates with the vibrations of the upper table, being kept in
its place by the spring (h, f). That the weight, during its vibration,
may be firmly kept in one fixed position, the holder (f) is fastened to
the ribs of the violin. On the other hand the shifting, very elastic
tail (h) above this holder, with its fastened end (h¹) over a peg (s),
grips the vibrating weight (g) controlling its movements up and down
upon the instrument.</p>

<p>With the spring (h) in position, one can then fix the screw and holder
(f) over any part of the ribs, bringing the weight (g) into action upon
various parts of the body of the violin. Yet its application will best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
succeed if brought upon the upper table, either in front of, or behind,
the bridge, under the two strings G and D, because here the wood of
the upper table is brought most into vibration, and also because the
most serviceable tones of these strings—particularly the notes of
the middle part of the scale—cause these subordinate and combination
tones most clearly to be heard. The spring being quite flexible, may
be bent to any shape, and in the circular form shown above helps the
firm position of the weight with respect to the amount of pressure. The
under, and somewhat concave, disk of the weight is covered with paper,
which agreeably modifies the tone quality.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="352" >
    <p class="f120"><i>Vibrator.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The use of the vibrator permits the production of curious and often
striking effects, especially in light and flowing playing, as,
perchance, in chorales, when three, four or more parts become audible
in regular harmonic sequence. The tone of the violin is caused to
resemble very much that of the harmonium, and nuances from the lightest
<i>piano</i> to at least <i>mezzo forte</i> are obtainable.</p>

<h3 id="APP-6">The Viola.</h3>

<p>The terms “Viola”, “Tenor”, “Bratsche”, “Alto”, and “Quinte”, are all
used in different countries to designate that member of the violin
family which is tuned a fifth lower than the violin. In England it is
commonly known as the Tenor, from the fact of its playing a part in
the string quartet analogous to that of the tenor voice in relation to
the other voices in part-singing. In Italy it was termed the “Viola di
braccio” to distinguish it from the larger viols which rested on the
ground or were supported by being placed between the performer’s knees.
“Viola” or “Alto” the Italians now term it, the music written for it
being in the alto clef (middle C on the 3ʳᵈ line):—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_111a.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="88" >
</div>

<p>The German term “Bratsche” is simply a corruption of “Braccio”.
“Quinte” is the name by which it is usually called in France,
indicating that it is tuned a fifth lower than the violin.</p>

<p>The tuning is as follows:—</p>

<div class="figcenter">
    <img src="images/i_111b.jpg" alt="_" width="400" height="145" >
</div>

<p>The G and C are both covered strings.</p>

<p>Occasional high passages necessitate the employment of the treble or
“violin” clef. Although its three upper strings are identical in pitch
with the three lowest of the violin, the quality is quite different,
the viola being more reedy and penetrating. This is due to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
disproportion between the deeper tuning of the instrument and its
dimensions, which are only about one-seventh greater than those of
the violin. Tenors were formerly made in several sizes. The ponderous
instruments of Gaspar da Salo and other Italian makers are of greater
interest to collectors than of practical utility, requiring arms of
exceptional length to play them. The large sized Violas were known as
the “Viola tenore”, and the ordinary sized instrument as the “Viola
alto”, and the two had often separate parts assigned to them in the
same composition, down to the time of Handel. Hence the survival of the
two names Alto and Tenor, applied in our own day to the same instrument.</p>

<p>The rich and sympathetic quality of tone of the viola renders it
eminently suited for the performance of Nocturnes, Elegies, and
melodies of a pathetic or tragic character. Some beautiful compositions
have been specially written for it, and it is to be regretted that
these are so very seldom heard in public.</p>

<p>From the penetrating character of the tone, new violas are invariably
harsher than new violins or violoncellos, but fortunately several good
makers of the last century have left a number of instruments which have
now become matured, and the demand being so much less than for violins,
a good medium sized viola may often be obtained at about half the cost
of a violin of the same quality.</p>

<p>Mr. Hermann Ritter of Heidelberg has in recent years endeavoured to
revive the large tenor under the name of Ritter’s Viola Alta. Several
of these instruments have been made, and they have been used with good
effect at the Bayreuth Wagner Festivals.</p>

<p>Vidal’s measurements of a Stradivarius Viola dated 1723, are as

With the same intention, Mr. E. J. Bonn, of Brading, Isle of Wight, has
produced a four-footed bridge, which, upon the testimony of those who
have tried it, has in some cases effected an improvement. Testimonials
from great artists concerning these and other attempts at improving
the violin frequently appear; meanwhile, the artists themselves are
well content with the bridge and the instrument generally as left by
Stradivarius. One would not desire to deny the <i>possibility</i> of
further improvements to the instrument, yet nearly two centuries of
ceaseless experimenting have yielded no result that has been considered
worthy of universal adoption. <i>Tr.</i></p>

<p>The quality of the wood in a bridge,—whether hard or soft—and its
thickness (according to Otto, its weight), materially affect the tone
of a violin. Bridges as supplied by dealers are usually almost twice
the proper thickness, to allow for rubbing down with sandpaper. The
best bridges are the genuine “Aubert” (with the name stamped inside an
oval); those with large and decided reddish markings showing hardness
of grain, and the less distinct markings a softer quality. When fitting
a violin, a few of each should be tried, first cutting the feet to the
approximate slope with a sharp penknife, then with a small piece of
fine (No. 0.) glass paper held steadily between the ff holes, rub the
bridge to and fro over the glass paper between the notches of the ff
holes, until, on removing the glass paper it is seen to fit perfectly,
standing upright when the instrument is level. The sketch shows the
amount of slope to be made on the E side; the distances for the notches
to receive the strings, and the amount to which the feet must be
thinned in an ordinary full sized instrument. The height of the bridge
is dependent, (for convenience of stopping), upon the height of the
fingerboard. A high bridge gives more power, but often the quality of
tone is not so good. The E string being harder to press down (by reason
of its greater tension) is kept a little nearer the fingerboard than
the others. From the end of the fingerboard, the E string should be
about this distance</p>

Box wood and rosewood are also frequently used for the pegs. The former
gives a firm hold, but makes a creaking noise when tuning. Rosewood
answers its purpose well, though it is not so strong as ebony, which
however is more apt to slip. <i>Tr.</i></p>

It is best to compare the ends before putting the string on, tying the
knot at the end which appears thinnest. The last inch or so at each end
of even the best string is often rough, and not so durable as the rest
of it. <i>Tr.</i></p>

To ensure equality of tone it is very important that
the strings should be correctly guaged with regard to their relative
thicknesses. If all the strings are too thick, the instrument will
speak with difficulty in delicate passages, demanding a heavier
pressure of the bow; if too thin, loss of power will be the result,
though with a corresponding gain in sweetness and clearness, and if one
string be much out of proportion to the others, the first finger when
placed properly on that string and the adjacent one will not yield a
perfect fifth, besides the inequality in power. The following diagram
shows a set of strings of medium thickness, together with the distances
apart near the bridge on a full sized violin, as suitable for ordinary
hands. For fingers that taper much towards the tips, or for those that
are very broad, the distances may be made a little narrower or wider
accordingly. First strings of silk, known as “Acribelles” are in great
demand by players with perspiring hands, as they are less affected by
moisture than gut, but the tone is not so good. They possess certain
advantages in durability, and standing well in tune, but are more
difficult to tune, as a very slight movement of the peg will send
them up half a tone. When frayed, they should be removed, the quality
of tone they then yield being very bad, affecting the other strings.
If gut strings of good quality are bought, and the strings carefully
looked at before playing, breakages at awkward moments will seldom
occur, as the strands generally give warning before breaking by showing
symptoms of unravelling, especially at the knot end, or under the
bow,—when they should at once be replaced. <i>Tr.</i></p>

Kid of reasonable substance gives a pleasant hold for the fingers,
although wire is in greater favour with bow makers for appearance sake.
But it is apt to tarnish and unravel, especially where the thumb comes
in contact with it. <i>Tr.</i></p>

A convenient form is that provided by many English dealers, consisting
simply of a round box,—preferably of tin,—with a hole in the bottom for
the finger to push the resin up, preserving the upper surface level. <i>Tr.</i></p>

The A may be taken from a pitch pipe, tuning fork, or piano, which
should be maintained at concert pitch. In old violins, if the belly
has yielded to pressure under the right foot of the bridge, it is
well after playing to let down the first string. If a string is too
flat, pull it up about a tone above the proper pitch, let it so remain
for a few seconds and then lower it to the correct pitch. If too
sharp, reverse the process. Only the A must be taken from a keyboard
instrument, the fifths on the keyboard being not quite perfect, but
“tempered”. Perfect fifths can only be obtained by a good deal of
practice. Advanced students may test the tuning quietly by taking
any two adjacent strings (with the little finger equally on both) in
harmonics, or by beating lightly with the stick on the string. In the
course of a piece, if even this is not possible, a slight pressure
above the nut will sharpen a string, tugging it between nut and bridge
will flatten; but this must only be regarded as a temporary expedient.

The real “holding”—as regards the weight of the instrument—is done at
the other end by the chin pressing the violin against the collar bone.
What further <i>steadying</i> power is necessary, the lower joint
of the thumb must supply, rather than the first finger. Players who
have attained considerable freedom are able to play certain passages
<i>without any portion of the side of the index finger coming into
contact with the neck</i>. Chin-rests of various patterns should be
tried, and that which best suits the particular player selected, as
bodily proportions differ. <i>Tr.</i></p>

The easiest keys for beginners are G, D and A major, as in these keys
the open strings may all be utilized; the fingers fall more naturally
into position, and do not require to be “set back” a semitone, as in
C major (F on the E string) and in the keys with flats. The scales
and easy melodies in G, D and A might therefore, be practised with
the following exercises, or if deemed advisable, precede them. <i>Tr.</i></p>

In the above examples the lowest note is played with a firm accent,
beginning with the down bow, the wrist remaining flexible. In example
<i>e</i> the bow should be turned over so as to bring the hair almost
flat upon the string, (the hair preferably being rather tighter than
usual). A slight “jerk” imparted to the down stroke sends the bow
skipping over the strings of its own accord, on repeating the same
arpeggio a few times. <i>Tr.</i></p>
